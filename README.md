# AI Agent Project Templates

This repository contains a set of templates to bootstrap a new software project with clear guidelines for AI-assisted development.

## How to Use

To start a new project using these templates, follow these steps:

1.  **Start a conversation with an AI assistant.**
2.  **Provide the assistant with the prompt from `PROMPT.md`**. This will configure the assistant to act as a "Project Scaffolding Assistant."
3.  **Answer the assistant's questions** about your project, such as its name, purpose, and technology stack.
4.  The assistant will use your answers to **generate three customized documents**:
    *   A project README (`PROJECT_README.md`)
    *   An AI agent instruction file (`AGENT.md`)
    *   A set of strict development rules for the agent (`RULES.md`)
5.  **Use these generated files** to bootstrap your new project repository.

## Core Components

*   **`PROMPT.md`**: A detailed prompt to configure an AI assistant to guide you through the project setup interview.
*   **`templates/`**: This directory contains the base templates that will be populated by the assistant based on your interview answers.
    *   `AGENT.md`: A template for providing instructions to an AI coding agent.
    *   `RULES.md`: A template for defining development standards and rules for an AI agent to follow.
    *   `PROJECT_README.md`: A comprehensive template for a project's `README.md` file.
